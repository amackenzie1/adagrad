The `ode.py` file contains code for the odes, linear or logistic regression; the `sgd.py` file contains a reference implementation of AdaGrad. The `main.py` file compares the two.

The `mcmc.py` contains a basic implementation of MCMC sampling so that we can get eigenvalues according to whatever law we want.

Most files should contain a `__main__` that demonstrates the usage. Plots are typically saved to the `plots/` directory.
